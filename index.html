    <div class="card project-card">
      <h3>Smart Glass For Blind People</h3>
      <p><strong>Team Size:</strong> 3  
      <br><strong>Mentor:</strong> Dr. Kalpana Pawase</p>
      <p> Smart blind glasses are wearable devices for visually impaired individuals. They use sensors to detect objects and obstacles. Provide
        real-time feedback through audio or haptic signals. Offer features like object recognition and sound haptics. Enhance mobility and
        independence. Improve safety and autonomy in daily activities. Ultrasonic sensor is used in this project. This is aurdino based project.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card project-card">
      <h3>Augmented Reality Business Card</h3>
      <p><strong>Team Size:</strong> 1</p>
      <p> I worked on AR (Agumented Reality) project in that I made a Business Card. Designed innovative augmented reality business card
        integrating virtual 3D objects showcasing personal info, photo, and social media links.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card project-card">
      <h3>Fire-Fighting Robot</h3>
      <p><strong>Team Size:</strong> 3  
      <br><strong>Mentor:</strong> Dr. Abhilasha Joshi</p>
      <p> We designed and built a prototype fire-fighting robot controlled via a Bluetooth module. The robot is equipped with temperature, flame,
         and smoke sensors that help detect fire in the surrounding area. Once fire is detected, the robot can be manually operated to move
         closer to the fire. A water pump installed on the robot is then used to spray water to control or extinguish the fire. To improve safety and
         visibility, we also added a camera module that provides a live view of areas that are too dangerous for humans to enter. This project
         combined both hardware and sensor integration to create a functional and cost-effective solution for fire emergencies.</p>

    <div class="card project-card">
      <h3>AI in Healthcare Website (Hackathon)</h3>
      <p><strong>Team Size:</strong> 4  
      <br><strong>Mentor:</strong> Dr. Aswathy M A</p>
      <p> We participated in an institute-level hackathon held at PCCOER College, where we developed a software-based project under the
         domain AI in Healthcare. Our project was a website designed to connect doctors and patients. The platform allowed patients to book
         appointments, share health concerns, and access basic health services. On the other hand, doctors could manage appointments and
         patient information. We also aimed to integrate basic AI features like symptom checking or recommendations to improve healthcare
         access and efficiency. The goal was to create a user-friendly platform to simplify doctor-patient interaction using technology.</p>
